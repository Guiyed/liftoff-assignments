# Project Outline

### MVP Overview
My project will be an Event ticketing App that will allow staff members at an organization to track Venue events that they offer. It will allow staff members to log in, and to create and edit events with details such as date/time, location, title, description. Also, it will allow as a consumer,  to search for events and make a reservation for the event.
This project is motivated as my personal future project. I would like to build an small but efficient Racing simulator Venue and I am going to need a master webpage/App where to do publicity online, have a list of interested users (emails) to do marketing campaigns, schedule reservations and more. This application can become a platform for any business owner with a similar business that can help manage users, reservations, tickets, etc. 

### MVP Features
	• Costumers Sign Up: consumers or costumers will be able to create a user.
	• User Login: Users will be able to log in by creating accounts in the system, or by using a third-party authentication provider (e.g. Google Authentication). 
	• Separated dashboard for Admins and Customers
	• As an Admin, Create and edit events: admins will be able to create new events in the system by entering in a mixture of required (title, date, time) and optional fields (description, max number of attendees, etc.)
	• View recent events: Users will be able to view a listing of events.
	• Online Registration (Event Booking): Users will be able to register for an event.

### What I'll Have to Learn
For the login functionality, I'll have to learn how to use third-party authentication(Google Authentication). Also, I will need to learn how to use and connect to different API such as Gmail API, Google Maps API and a free QR API.
I would like to learn how display an Interactive Calendar on the Front end of the webpage to make the user experience more easy to view events by dates and make reservations. Also, how to add advertisement spaces on the page.
