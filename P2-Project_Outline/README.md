I would like to build an small but efficient Racing simulator Venue and I am going to need a master webpage/App where to do publicity online, have a list of interested users (emails) to do marketing campaigns, schedule reservations and more. This application can become a platform for any business owner with a similar business that can help manage users, reservations, tickets, etc.
